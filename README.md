# Justice by Iron Tree

## About
Justice by Iron Tree is a platform that helps to erase unjust cannabis records.
The automated and simplified process saves victims weeks of stress and
thousands of dollars in legal fees. The over-prosecution of cannabis related
offenses have significant negative impacts on many people, and
disproportionately low-income communities of color.

The code is in a private repo, this page is simply set up as a "landing page"
of sorts for people looking at my GitHub account.

You can learn more by checking out the platform at
https://justice.irontreeca.com. If you inspect the page, you'll see a little
signature from me ;) .

## Design
By no means am I a designer. If you give me a mockup, I can implement it. But,
ask me to design something from scratch? Well...this is kind of what you get
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Future improvements
- Better design on varying screen sizes.
- Update the design on the form pages.
- Update the system emails.
